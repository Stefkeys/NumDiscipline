# #DISCIPLINE (aka NumDiscipline)

### Modifications from original Discipline 

- Add numpad on right.
- Move arrow keys 0.25U down and right, similar to 1800 layout. 
- Adjust component layout on top of board, moving ATMega and buttons to the right, adding in more diodes in center. 
- Removed ~, Delete, Page Up, Page Down keys. These will be on alternate layer. 
- Created Digikey version of BOM, found here: https://octopart.com/bom-tool/AgAHKWUi
