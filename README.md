# #DISCIPLINE (aka NumDiscipline)


A modified version of the great looking Discipline through hole keyboard design by coseyfannitutti to add numpad. 

## Modifications from original Discipline 

- Add numpad on right.
- Move arrow keys 0.25U down and right, similar to 1800 layout. 
- Adjust component layout on top of board, moving ATMega and buttons to the right, adding in more diodes in center. 
- Removed ~, Delete, Page Up, Page Down keys. These will be on alternate layer. 
- Created Digikey version of BOM, found here: https://octopart.com/bom-tool/AgAHKWUi


## ToDo 
- Adjust acrylic foot design to be wider, it looks a little thin. 
- add Via support
- Next order of PCBs: 
	- Adjust #DISCIPLINE logo in space bar area so that it doesn't overlap stablaizer. [Image](./images/knownIssues/Logoplacement.jpg)
	- Omit job number silk screen from vendor.[Plate](./images/knownIssues/plate.jpg) [Main](./images/knownIssues/jobNumMain.jpg) [Bottom](./images/knownIssues/jobNumBottom.jpg) 
	- Improve surface finish on black solder mask, some dark spots. [Image](./images/knownIssues/surfaceFinish.jpg) 
	- Remove drills from FR4 switch plate. [Image](./images/knownIssues/plate.jpg)
